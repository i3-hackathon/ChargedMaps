# ChargedMaps

This project is currently *heavily* tuned torwards Android devices (specifically the Moto X)
  The project is capable of being much more portable to other platforms with some refactoring

*This project was designed to work for presentations, so many of the features are incomplete and
don't work with all options.*

- Routing to maximize EV time

- Preferential treatment towards higher powered charging stations

- Connected with car battery & fuel levels to give driving estimates and range
